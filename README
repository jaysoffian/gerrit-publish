About Gerrit Publish
--------------------

gerrit-publish.sh is designed to make it easier to work with [Gerrit Code
Review](http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/).

In particular, it performs the following actions when run:

- Looks at all changes between the current branch head and its upstream.
- Adds a `Change-Id` footer to any messages missing such footer.
- Rewraps the messages using fmt (if available) to conform to Gerrit's
  sensibilities (first line <= 65 characters, each subsquent line wrapped to 70
  characters).
- Pushes to the correct `refs/for/`<i>`name`</i> pseudo-ref which it figures out
  automatically from the current branch's configured upstream branch.
